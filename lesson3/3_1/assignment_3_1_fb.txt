 focusing on the "My Shelves" feature of the New York Public Library website.

 For example, here is mine: 

http://nypl.bibliocommons.com/collection/show/95209161_franburch/library/completed

For the sake of simplicity, I have only modeled users, shelves, and books, and excluded some other items that could be included, such as Audiobooks, Movies & TV, etc.

One user may have one shelf. 
One shelf may have many books.
Each shelf item (shelves_books) may have one status.
One book may have one format. (book_formats)

Book shelves may be filtered by statuses, such as In Progress, Completed, For Later.
